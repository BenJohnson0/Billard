# Interactive Billard
 
The Interative Billard will project useful informations (such as speed, acceleration...) directly on the board

# Requirement

You need to have at least a **Billard**, a **Webcam** and a **Video Projector**

# How does it work ?

There are four files numbered from 1 to 4:

1. The first file "1-Camera.py" will let you choose which camera you want to use to interact with the pool table.

2. The second file "2-Calibration.py" will ask you to mark the corners of the billiard table with a red dot, as in the picture. Then the program will project a square pattern on the billiard table. You will have to superimpose the four dots on the four dots projected on the billiard table.

3. The third file, "3-Detection", will ask you to remove all the elements from the billiard table.

4. The fourth file will project live information on the billiard table.
